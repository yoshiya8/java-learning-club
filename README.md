You are going to need to install several tools on your computer
## Git
Git is a revision control system that will:
* Keep track of every change we make
* Will allow us to share our work
* Will allow us to work together

You will need to download Git and install it from: https://git-scm.com

When install Git, there will be several screens asking you questions. Just select next to accept the default for each of these questions.

## JDK 8
You will need to download and install the Java Development Kit 8 to program in Java - this contains the Java compiler which converts Java code into bit-code, and the Java virtual machine which will run the bit-code for your programs.

1. http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
2. Find the "download" button corresponding to the JDK and click on it (NOT THE NETBEANS VERSION)
3. Select "Accept License Agreement" in the Java SE Development Kit 8u66 box
4. There will be download links for many different operating systems. Click on the download for your computer system (probably Windows x64	if your computer is reasonably new)
5. Run the downloaded file to install the JDK 8 on your computer.
6. Just like with Git click next through all the questions on the installer.

You will also need to get a GitHub.com account at https://github.com
